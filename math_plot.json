	"introduction": "You're in a room with dusty row of numbered keys and a dull grey terminal screen. It doesn't look like anyone has been in here for some time. As you approach the terminal, it sparks into life and displays a simple sum.",
	"1": "\n\nAn old man enters the room with the dusty terminal. He hands you a card with a big 1 on it.\n'You're now Level 1,' he says. 'You can come through.'\nHe brings you into a room with a similar machine, but much less dusty, and turns it on.\n'Work on this for a bit,' he says, then leaves.",
	"3": "\n\nThe old man pops into the room. \n'You might have noticed the questions getting harder.'\n'I'll come back if you get to level 5.'\n\nYou're now Level 3.",
	"5": "\n\nThe old man comes back into the room. \n'OK, you can add pretty well. Come on up to the Level 5 room.'\n\nThere are a few other people in this room, sitting at terminals, pressing buttons and sweating.\n\n'Here's your terminal. Good luck! We're all counting on you.'\n\nThis terminal has a flatscreen monitor, but otherwise it looks a lot like the earlier desks.",
	"6": "\n\n'Truth time now.' The old man has snuck up behind you.\n'The computers have forgotten how to do maths, so we need to help them out. Every time someone types something into a calculator, one of our operatives enters the answer. Are you up to it?'",
